WARNING: At least the latter scripts (run-second, run-third) are DESTRUCTIVE, that means they will erase ALL DATA from the tables they insert to.

1. To initialize database, run the first script (run-first)
2. To insert testing data (no images), run the second script (run-second)
3. To insert testing data for images, you need to first edit 'run-third' with filepaths to images & then execute it (run-third)
